# Setup Guide

## The Modpack

Setting up the modpack is easy, but is quite unique from traditional setups. Because of this, we ask that you follow every step in this guide in order to properly download all of the mods and ensure you can jump into sessions without any issues.

We ask you to **please make sure to read all the points before you begin installation.**

### Installing

1. Subscribe to the modpack on the [Steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3360539113).

2. Open up the ArmA III launcher, select the **Mods** tab, and select **Unload All** in the top-right if available.

3. Under **Available Mods**, enable the **Phoenix Legion Modpack** mod and then select the **Load Selected Mods** option.

4. Wait for the launcher to download and enable the mods and then youâ€™re all done!

#### DLC Requirements

We currently don't require any of the DLCs to be installed.

<!-- The modpack requires the following DLCs to be installed:

- [Arma 3 Creator DLC: Western Sahara](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681170/Arma_3_Creator_DLC_Western_Sahara/)
- [Arma 3 Creator DLC: Reaction Forces](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2647760/Arma_3_Creator_DLC_Reaction_Forces/)

If you don't have these DLCs, you will need to load the **compatibility data mods** for them:

- [Western Sahara Compatibility Data](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2636962953)
- [Reaction Forces Compatibility Data](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3150497912) -->

### Updating

Updating the modpack is simple! All you need to do is restart your **ArmA III Launcher**, **Unload All** mods, then reload the **Phoenix Legion Modpack** mod you downloaded to begin with along with it's dependencies.

<!-- Remember to **re-enable the DLCs or their compatibility data mods.** -->

## Radio Setup (ACRE2)

Installing and setting up ACRE2 is easy! When we use ACRE2 it is automatically installed in our modpack and **once you launch the game it will automatically set up in your TeamSpeak 3 client!** All you need to do is just **enable the plugin** found in **Tools -> Options -> Addons** of your TS3 client. In case you have TFAR installed **make sure to disable it within the TS3 Client.**

## Configuration

### Disable BattlEye

Make sure you disable Battleye when playing with us! To do this, just open the Arma 3 launcher, go to the "Battleye" option on the left side of it and untick "Enable BattlEye anti-cheat software."

### In-Game Name

You are required to change your in-game profile name to the shortened name assigned to you when you joined the unit. If you are unable to change the profile name, please create a new one with the name assigned. This simply used for identification purposes.

### Controls

#### Grenade Throwing

It is recommended to set the keybinding for grenades (when throwing them) to "double-tapping" the 'g' key.
